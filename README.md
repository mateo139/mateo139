👋 Hi I'm **Mateusz !**

⚙ I'm a graduate master of engineering, but in fact the **biggest satisfaction is given by building bridges between people and technology**. That's why I love analyzing data, problems and the nature of physics!

📈 I have **experience in developing IT tools for supporting sales and manufacturing processes** using Excel/VBA. 

🖥️ I've **cooperated not only with developers** of web applications, ERP system and databases (Python/C#/SQL), but **also with different specializations of engineers** , as well as with **sales departments and business owners**.

🐍 On this ```GitHub profile``` I want do train and present my **Python programing skills progress**.

💪 **In the future I want to develop professional software for engineers as a programer or technical analyst...**
